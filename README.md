# ✨Read me✨
*Compte créé par @cake-and-despair pour le cours SCI6201 de l'EBSI*

- 🔭 __I’m currently working on__ completing my master's degree in information science and library services. My thesis will discuss LGBTQIA2S+ representation in public library collections. 
- 🌱 __I’m currently learning__ ruby and I'm not great at it, but I'm worse at python so there's that. 
- 💬 __Ask me about my passion for__ the colour violet and impressionism, or why free-text descriptive fields are the best tool to improve your catalogue's searchability and materials' discoverability. 
- 📫 __How to reach me__: jessica.lachapelle-scullion@umontreal.ca 
- 😄 __Pronouns__: I have no preference, thanks for asking. What about yours?  
- ⚡ __Fun fact__: Clownfish are all born male and have the ability to control both their size and their gender (in adulthood). They have complex social behaviours and hierarchies and groups are led by one female. When she dies, the largest male will change sex and become the leading female, the remaining male will go up the social ladder, so will their size. 
- 📖 __I'm currently reading__ The Genesis of Misery by Neon Yang.
